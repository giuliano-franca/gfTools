How to use:
    * Copy the plugin file to the MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH.
    * To find MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH paste this command in a Python tab:
        import os; os.environ["MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH"].split(";")
    * In Maya, go to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager.
    * Find the plugin file and import it. Can be:
        Windows: gfTools.mll
        OSX: gfTools.bundle
        Linux: gfTools.so

Requirements:
    * Maya 2017 or above.

Description:
    Node to visualize vectors in the viewport and vector math operations.
    Draws a simple arrow to represent the vector connected.
    Operates vector addition, subtraction and cross product.

Attributes:
    * Line Width: Control the width of the lines drawed.
    * Color: Color of the lines.
    * Radius: Radius of the arrow.
    * Tip Size: The size of the tip of the arrow.
    * Subdivisions: The number of subdivisions of the arrow.
    * XRay: Draw the vector in top of other objects.
    * Operation: The math operation. (No operation will return Vector 1 attribute)
    * Vector 1: The first vector of the operation.
    * Vector 2: The second vector of the operation.
    * Normalize: Normalize the output vector.
    * OutVector: The result vector of the operation.

Todo:
    * RGBA Support.
