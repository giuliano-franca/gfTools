How to use:
    * Copy the plugin file to the MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH.
    * To find MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH paste this command in a Python tab:
        import os; os.environ["MAYA_PLUG_IN_PATH"].split(";")
    * In Maya, go to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager.
    * Find the plugin file and import it. Can be:
        Windows: gfTools.mll
        OSX: gfTools.bundle
        Linux: gfTools.so

Requirements:
    * Maya 2017 or above.

Description:
    Custom parent contraint. Parent one object to another. Can be used as point, orient
    or scale constraint.

Attributes:
    * Offset: The matrix offset between the source and target objects.
    * Target World Matrix: The world matrix of the target object.
    * Constraint Parent Inverse Matrix: The world inverse matrix of the parent of the constrainted object.
    * Out Constraint: The output matrix of the constraint.

Todo:
    * Add support to joint orient.
    * Add support to rotation order.
    * Add support to weights.

Sources:
    * NDA
