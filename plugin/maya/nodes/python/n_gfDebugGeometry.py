Disclaimer:
    THIS PLUGIN IS JUST A PROTOTYPE. YOU MUST USE THE C++ RELEASE PLUGIN FOR PRODUCTION.
    YOU CAN FIND THE C++ RELEASE PLUGIN FOR YOUR SPECIFIC PLATFORM IN RELEASES FOLDER:
    "gfTools > plug-ins > release"

How to use:
    * Copy the parent folder to the MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH.
    * To find MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH paste this command in a Python tab:
        import os; os.environ["MAYA_SCRIPT_PATH"].split(";")
    * In Maya, go to Windows > Settings/Preferences > Plug-in Manager.
    * Browse for "gfTools > plug-ins > dev > python"
    * Find gfTools_P.py and import it.

Requirements:
    * Maya 2017 or above.

Description:
    Node to visualize vectors in the viewport and vector math operations.
    Draws a simple arrow to represent the vector connected.
    Operates vector addition, subtraction and cross product.

Attributes:
    * Line Width: Control the width of the lines drawed.
    * Color: Color of the lines.
    * Radius: Radius of the arrow.
    * Tip Size: The size of the tip of the arrow.
    * Subdivisions: The number of subdivisions of the arrow.
    * XRay: Draw the vector in top of other objects.
    * Operation: The math operation. (No operation will return Vector 1 attribute)
    * Vector 1: The first vector of the operation.
    * Vector 2: The second vector of the operation.
    * Normalize: Normalize the output vector.
    * OutVector: The result vector of the operation.

Todo:
    * RGBA Support.
